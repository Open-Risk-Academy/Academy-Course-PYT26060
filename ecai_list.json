This is expressed by a relevant rating category within the corresponding rating scale. Creditworthiness (financial accountability, financial stability) shall be interpreted as the Rated Entity?s ability to fulfill its financial obligations. The Rated Entity?s credit rating does not assess credit risk concerning any financial debt instruments issued by the Rated Entity. A credit rating does not serve as a recommendation to purchase, sell, or otherwise dispose of a security. Credit rating users shall perform their own independent assessments of their counterparties? creditworthiness and shall not rely wholly on credit ratings. Credit ratings of financial liabilities or financial liability issue programs: Financial liability shall be interpreted as the Rated Entity?s obligations regarding the financial instruments it issues. A credit rating assigned by ACRA Europe to a financial liability or financial liability issue program reflects the Agency?s subjective opinion on the Rated Entity?s ability to fulfill its outstanding financial obligations on individual financial debt instruments or total financial liabilities. This is expressed by alphanumeric symbols reflecting the relevant rating notch within the corresponding rating scale. The Agency considers the fundamental terms of a financial instrument, including its collateral structure, contractual subordination, and structural subordination, which can affect payments on the given financial liability or instrument if the Rated Entity defaults on this or any other financial liabilities or instruments. Fundamental credit ratings include credit ratings assigned to Rated Entities representing the corporate sector (or their financial liabilities or financial liability issue programs), banking institutions, non-banking financial institutions, insurance companies, sovereigns, as well as regional and municipal governments. Expected credit ratings: In the process of assigning a credit rating to financial instruments, including structured finance instruments and obligations, and when determining the Rated Entity?s ability to fulfill its liabilities on specific financial liabilities or issued debt instruments, ACRA Europe may draw its conclusions based on draft issue documentation. In those instances, the Agency assigns an ?Expected? credit rating, which is one step of the credit rating assignment and is marked with the symbol ?E.? For fundamental credit ratings, the ?Expected? status is assigned for a 90-day period, while for structured finance obligations it is assigned for a 180-day period. Once the final issue documentation is received, ACRA Europe shall assign a credit rating to the financial instrument, which may diverge from the initial ?Expected? rating.  The Standalone Creditworthiness Assessment (SCA) reflects the Agency?s subjective opinion on the Rated Entity?s ability to fulfill its financial liabilities in a full and timely fashion. However, the SCA does not consider the following factors: 1) extraordinary external support from the Supporting Organization/owners; 2) extraordinary external support from the federal government; 3) the Rated Entity?s systemic value; 4) other external factors capable of affecting the Rated Entity?s creditworthiness.",

The entity rating of Assekurata rates German primary insurance companies from the point of view of their essential creditors, the policy holders. The method specified goes beyond the focus of a creditworthiness rating, i.e. the assessment of the solvency. \nThe overall quality of the entity is primarily analysed and rated from the customer's point of view based on differentiated partial qualities. \nThe partial qualities deal with security, success, growth/attractiveness in the market and the customer orientation of the insurer. These criteria of life insurers are supplemented by profit sharing/performance and the private health insurers are supplemented by the partial quality premium stability.\nThe rating scale of entity rating is subdivided in eleven quality findings from A++ [excellent] to D [poor], which are summed up in five categories. Companies rated A++ to B- are considered reliable. The creditworthiness rating of Assekurata evaluates the financial capacity of German insurance and reinsurance companies. Thereby both key factors of the business world and overall factors of the business world are evaluated. The key factors include both quantitative ratings such as for instance the calculation of a Value-at-Risk coverage rate and also a qualitative rating of entity management.\nThe rating scale of creditworthiness rating is subdivided into 22 credit rating categories ranging from AAA [prime rating] to D [in default]. These are subdivided in nine master categories which classify the existing creditworthiness and the default risk in such connection verbally. The rating outlook is divided into the categories negative, stable, positive.\t\t\n\nThe Assekurata ratings are based on the following principles:\nSolicitation: Insurers are rated on their own request. Assekurata does not issue unsolicited ratings.\nPayment: The rating process has to be paid for by the insurer. The costs depend on the complexity and structure of the company.\nWillingness to give information based on internal records: The Assekurata rating is based on internal information, for example strategy plans and audit reports, and includes management interviews. In addition Assekurata contracts a professional market research institute with the performance of customers interviews. As a result the analysts get an impression of the customer's view concerning the insurer's service. \nStrict confidentiality: Internal information given to Assekurata is dealt with utmost discretion.\nUnanimously decision: The Assekurata-rating-committee is made up of the respective senior analyst, the subject coordinator quality management of Assekurata and at least two external experts. The rating decisions have to be unanimous.\nPublication after release: The rating will be published only if the insurer agrees, otherwise Assekurata maintains confidentiality about the proceeding and its result. After a published rating has lost its validity, Assekurata publishes this fact in a press release.\nDocumentation: Different forms of presentation, according to the different recipients and media, are issued. The extensive management report is exclusively for the management board of the company concerned. Here all aspects of the rating are explained in detail so that the insurer can follow the decision. The rating report is published on the homepage of Assekurata. \nIt explains the rating for consumers, investors, brokers and the trade press. The press release is a brief summary where the partial results and the final rating are named. The rating logo enables the potential customer to identify the insurer's rating result at first glance.\nRegular update: An Assekurata-rating can be used for one year after completion. During this time Assekurata continuously observes the rating. For further use an update is compulsory.",

The corporate credit rating implies assessment of the risk from default or inability to pay the liabilities of a given company. This risk has various sources and is examined on several levels: risk, related to the sector (where basic trends in the sector are analyzed, and their impact on the analyzed company, the structure of the sector and its relationships to other sectors and industries), business-risk (operations of the company, product mix, market share, quality of management), and financial risk (analyzed through Profitability, Operating Return, Debt and Liquidity ratios). The rating of insurance companies assigned by BCRA?CREDIT RATING AGENCY is a Rating of the Ability to Pay Claims (RAPC). RAPC is a culmination of an analytical process, which explores the dynamics of the market, the regulatory frame and the main operative and financial indicators of the given insurance company. BCRA?CREDIT RATING AGENCY studies the insurance activity and investments of the company, reinsurance strategy, business advantages as well as ownership, management and strategic focus. In order to determine the credit rating of a leasing company BCRA?CREDIT RATING AGENCY investigates several risks: risk, connected with the sector (including its historical development as well as present state), business risk (operating activity and portfolio of the company, market share and competitive position, as well as the management), and financial risk (analyzed through four main areas: profitability, operating effectiveness, indebtedness, and liquidity). The Credit Rating of a Municipality presents an impartial assessment of its creditworthiness. The rating is based on the analysis of several areas, including legal framework and trends in the development of municipalities, economic factors, profile of debt and future needs for funding, municipal finance (income and spending part, investments in infrastructure) and quality of administrative/management strategies. For better assessment of the municipality and its competitiveness it is positioned against other selected municipalities by main quantitative indicators. The ratings of the pension funds of pension - insurance companies present an appraisal from the viewpoint of the insured persons. The determination of the rating of a pension - insurance company consists of analyses made in the following directions: legal framework of the pension insurance, appraisal of the investment activity, financial analysis (with respect to liquidity, in the first place) and analysis of the quality of management. The credit rating of liabilities of a group of companies reviews several risks: risk, connected with the sector (main trends, legal framework), business risk (competitive position, operating activity, main point is the appraisal of the management) and financial risk (in terms of profitability, operating effectiveness, indebtedness, liquidity). The companies of the group are being assessed with a view of their strategic meaning for the group based on a set of criteria. The ?key? and ?strategically significant? companies in the team of the group are defined. When issuing a sovereign rating, BCRA?CREDIT RATING AGENCY analyses a large number of quantitative and qualitative rating factors organized into four separate categories: 1. Political Risk; 2. Macroeconomic Stability; 3. Fiscal Flexibility; 4. Effectiveness of the Monetary Policy.",

The ratings? objective is a probability of default. The CRA has implemented a rating methodology that combines in general qualitative and quantitative criteria.\nThe CRA?s ratings are solicited ratings. The relevant data are internal as well as external publicly available information. Internal data are non public information of the customer and information of the CRA. All data are proved of reliability and are compared with industry sector benchmarks.\nThe qualitative analysis is based on rating relevant indicators of the company?s actual business process. Rating analysts compare the company?s situation with probable best practice solutions of the industry. Plausibility checks of the company?s long term planning under different scenarios will be added.\nRelevant factors are discussed and checked in terms of plausibility in an interview with the management. Strength and weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT analysis) will be identified by the analysts.\nThe analysis of the company?s financials (investments, financing, liquidity and profits) is the basis of the quantitative part of the rating methodology. The company?s annual accounts (single and consolidated accounts) are the relevant input. Usually audited reports will be provided by the customer.\nThe financial information of the annual accounts will be analysed by a system based rating approach. Within a first step data of the annual accounts (balance sheet and profit and loss statement) are structured by the analysts on the basis of an internal calculation sheet of the CRA. A variety of financial ratios are calculated by using the structured financial data. The ratios are analysed in terms of development over time and over business sector benchmarks. Empirical default studies give a valid indication of significant ratios specification.\nThe actual company?s performance will be taken into account on the basis of monthly or quarterly reports. Those will be compared with the past development (annual reports) and the planning of the company.\nThe results of the qualitative analyses will be stressed by the SWOT analyses of qualitative factors. Different scenarios of future cash flows show the probability of fulfilment of debt repayment. This is the basis of the final rating.\nThe rating methodology in general draws upon the opinion of the rating analysts and the rating committee. It integrates the quantitative and qualitative criteria. Because the CRA builds rating teams and has installed a rating committee a high degree of objectivity can be achieved. The CRA?s ratings are essentially an opinion of potential results and risks in the future. \nThe team of rating analysts presents the rating relevant factors to the rating committee. The rating committee decides the rating.\nThe rating is a long term indication of the probability of default. It will be monitored for one year. \nThe rating of a bond sets up on the rating of the company that issues the bond. Collaterals or guarantees or a specific rank of the bond as a debt position might lead to a different bond rating than the company rating.\nThe rating of structured financing will take into account the specific waterfall of payments to different classes of investments that are elements of a transaction.",

According to CRIF Ratings\ufffd corporate rating methodology, ratings take into account both qualitative and quantitative factors related to the business and financial risks of issuers (\ufffdIssuer rating\ufffd) and their specific debt instruments (\ufffdIssue rating\ufffd). An Issuer rating is an opinion on the ability of a subject to honor its financial obligations in full and on time. The assessment focuses on the ability of the debtor to repay its financial obligations irrespective of their ranking. The Issue rating is an opinion on the relative risk of default of a specific debt instrument. The assessment takes into account the level of expected loss on the instrument in the event of default, which will depend on the guarantees supporting the underlying debt obligation and the degree of subordination of the instrument itself in the Issuer\ufffds capital structure. Issuer and Issue rating can be both Short-Term (\ufffdST\ufffd) and Long-Term (\ufffdLT\ufffd).  A single issuer may carry both ST rating and LT rating at the same time whilst a single debt instrument may only carry one type of Issue rating. Issue ST ratings are referred to issues with an original maturity of 12 months or less; Issue LT ratings are referred to issues with an original maturity over 12 months. \nCRIF Ratings\ufffd SME ratings express an opinion on the creditworthiness of a non-financial corporation whose total turnover is comprised between EUR 5m and EUR 75m. According to CRIF Ratings\ufffd SME rating methodology, ratings assessment starts from quantitative analysis, based on specific models developed selecting the most predictive financial indicators for the relevant industry. The SME assessment is then adjusted to reflect the company belonging to a group of companies and to incorporate qualitative, judgmental assessments by CRIF Ratings analysts. A SME rating is an opinion, relative to the SME universe, on the ability of a company to honor its financial obligations in full and on time. The assessment focuses on the ability of the debtor to repay its financial obligations irrespective of their ranking. SME Ratings are exclusively Long-Term (\ufffdLT\ufffd). \nCRIF Ratings\ufffd methodologies have been validated. The initial validation regards the consistency of the methodology employed.

It assesses business risk by examining elements such as industry risk, market positioning, competitive positioning, cost efficiency, management, strategy and governance. It is EHRs belief that these qualitative factors cannot be fully captured by data alone or quantified in a standardised process. Financial risk, by contrast, is determined by analysing the companys financial statements. This process analyses and evaluates parameters such as financing structures, financing policies, profitability, cash flow generation and financial flexibility. The essence of any analysis is the assessment of a companys general future ability and willingness to fulfill financial commitments on time. For that reason, plans and planning assumptions are evaluated and analysed particularly carefully when aggregating financial risk and individual business risk. Issue ratings refer to specific financial instruments (bond, Schuldschein loan, etc.). In the rating process, analysts evaluate the probability of default and the loss severity for a specific financial instrument. An issue rating is generally based on the issuers rating. However, it also takes account of features specific to the instrument such as the creditors position in the event of bankruptcy, which in turn depends on contract terms such as subordination, negative pledges or financial covenants. As a result, a corporate bond may have a better or worse rating than the entity that issued it.\nProject ratings: Project ratings primarily assess the amount and stability of future cash flows as well as the creditors position if the project is liquidated. Historical data is often not available. The purpose of a project rating is to evaluate the performance of an investment in a distinct project that generates its own cash flow (e.g., solar farms, aviation finance, real estate, wind farms) based on the project plan and economic viability assessment. The Agency transparently presents material planning assumptions, particularly if they are uncertain, and then identifies and consistently evaluates the extent to which actual results may realistically depart from the planning assumptions. Agency analysts systematically identify technical, economic and legal risks that may arise during construction and operation. Then, they simulate these systematically analysed planning risks (stochastic financial model) in order to determine the frequency of illiquidity and overindebtedness scenarios and thus the likelihood of insolvency. \nStructured finance ratings: A credit portfolio containing numerous fixed-income financial instruments such as loans and bonds allows risk to be diversified across all the underlying financial securities. As a consequence, a portfolio generally has a lower risk of default than an individual security. A structured finance rating expresses the likelihood that the portfolio principal will be paid back with the agreed interest by the end of the portfolio term. EHR uses analytical and simulation-based models to assess credit portfolios based on their composition, the individual risk of the underlying financial securities and the cash flows for the entire portfolio. This information, along with qualitative characteristics, is used to determine the structured finance rating.",

EuroRating uses a single, transparent long-term rating scale (?AAA? to ?D?), which is common to all rating types, although the agency uses different rating methodologies for specific types of the rated entities. The long-term perspective of the credit risk assessment applies to a time horizon of up to the next three years. As the rating methodology used by EuroRating takes into account the susceptibility of the rated entity to changes in currency exchange rates and the overall country risk, the agency does not differentiate the rating scale on local and foreign currency. The ratings issued by EuroRating are therefore comparable to ratings issued by other credit rating agencies in the international scale. The ratings issued by EuroRating reflect a combination of both the likelihood of default and any financial loss suffered by creditors in the event of default. EuroRating?s credit ratings are not a relative ranking of the credit risk of the rated entities, but they are evaluations of the credit risk of individual rated entities in the absolute scale of risk. When assessing the financial credibility of a rated entity EuroRating uses quantitative and qualitative analytical methods. Quantitative assessment includes mainly an analysis of financial statements of the company (preferably for a period of at least the last ten years, taking also into account the most recent quarterly reports and forecasts for the future), conducted using, among others, scoring models for credit risk assessment tailored for specific industries. An important element of quantitative analysis is an assesment of the stability of financial indicators, as well as the dynamics and direction of changes in fundamental values characterizing the condition of the rated company. The methodology attaches great importance to the analysis of cash flows, which are particularly important from the point of view of a solvency of a company. The assessment of the financial situation of a company includes also a comparative analysis, involving the assessment of both the individual parameters as well as the overall risk profile of the company in relation to other entities constituting its reference group. Qualitative analysis includes a wide range variety of factors, which are not easy to quantify and which require in each case an expert evaluation. These include i.a.: the current and forecasted general economic situation; country specific risk factors; the situation in the industry; the company?s market position; dependence on suppliers or customers; quality and market value of company?s assets; vulnerability to changes in exchange rates and/or in commodities prices; business model; quality and innovation of products; experience and qualifications of the management; the accounting principles used; as well as the ownership structure and the likelihood of external support in the event of financial difficulties. A combination of the results of the quantitative and qualitative analysis, requiring in each case an expert judgement of EuroRating?s rating analysts and rating committees, allows to make a final assessment of economic and financial situation of the rated company and of its ability to meet financial obligations in a long term and allows the agency to assign a reliable credit rating.",

FERI?s opinions are forward looking and include analysts' views of future performance. FERI?s methodologies are made publicly available and include industry and product specific methodologies in the areas of Sovereigns, Corporate Finance, Structured Finance and Covered Bonds. The FERI Country Credit Rating provides a forward looking assessment of the creditworthiness of a countries? sovereign from the perspective of a foreign creditor. The rating uses model-based forecasts of future economic and structural developments. The forecast is updated and reviewed monthly. Each month the forecast is condensed via a rating system to which the FERI Rating algorithm is applied. The general assessment sequence for the rating algorithm is as follows: indicators are selected and are given certain weights; time periods and time weights are defined and each single indicator is weighted across time. The result is an indicator ranging between 0 and 100 points. This total indicator is split into 21 rating classes, the best being AAA (lowest default risk) to CC (highest default risk) as well as the category D (default). Government bonds of an issuer rated BB+ or below fall into the category ?Non-Investment Grade?. In addition to the quantitative result, the rating analyst provides a qualitative assessment and proposes the preliminary FERI Country Credit Rating to the rating committee. The result of the Country Credit Rating is determined by a sovereign's ability and willingness to repay its debt. The analysis applies four risk indicators separating public finance, domestic economic risks, external economic risks and political risks. The evaluation of credit risks looks at the size of the actual debt as well as at its sustainability, i.e., the nature and scope of financing. While external economic risks are determined mainly by balance and structure of capital and current accounts, the domestic economic risk and the political risk of a country are measured by economic and political stability indicators. Data sources comprise notifications and publications of international organizations (e.g. UNO, IMF, UNIDO, Eurostat), national organizations (e.g. offices for national statistics, national central banks) and other public authorities (e.g. government departments). All other credit ratings for secured debt issuances are based on an Expected Loss approach. This means, that a expected loss calculated under various stress scenarios will be mapped using the weighted average life of the rated instrument to derive the rating on FERI?s 21 notch rating scale from AAA to D. The corporate rating/issuer rating is a PD-rating and based on FERI?s industry rating, the assessment of the opportunities and threats of the relevant market and the corporate individual strength and weakness profile (including the balance sheet/profit and loss statement). In case of an unsecured corporate bond the issuer rating will be used as benchmark for notching up/down based on the issuance characteristics.",

In addition, with respect to structured finance ratings, ratings in the 'CC' category and below are considered by FERI to be materially impaired. All such ratings are therefore also captured within CEREP default statistics in accordance with CEREP reporting requirements.A default of a sovereign marked as ?default? is defined as a situation when a principal or interest payment is missed on the due date (or within the specified grace period). A default occurs as well in the case of a distressed exchange, when the exchange serves to help the sovereign avoid missed interest or principal payments."

    "has_methodology_description": "Fitch's ratings are opinions based on established criteria and methodologies which are continuously evaluated and updated. They are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual/or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating. Ratings are not facts and are not \"accurate\"/\"inaccurate\".\n\nFitch's opinions are forward looking and include analysts' views of future performance. These views may include forecasts, which may in turn\n(i) be informed by non-disclosable management projections,\n(ii) be based on a trend (sector or wider economic cycle) at a certain stage in the cycle, or\n(iii) be based on historical performance.\nMaterial changes in economic conditions and expectations (for a particular issuer) may result in a rating change. Ratings only address credit risk.\n\nRatings are relative measures of risk. As opinions on relative ranking of vulnerability to default, they do not imply/convey a specific statistical probability of default, notwithstanding the agency's published default histories that may be measured against ratings at the time of default.\n\nRatings are opinions based on all information known to Fitch, including publicly available information and/or non-public documents/information provided to the agency by an issuer and other parties.\n\nIn issuing/maintaining its ratings, Fitch relies on factual information received from issuers/underwriters/other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its rating methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction.\n\nThe investigations and scope of the third-party verification will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third-party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.\n\nUltimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating was issued or affirmed. If any such information should turn out to contain misrepresentations or to be otherwise misleading, the rating associated with that information may not be appropriate.\n\nIn the default components of ratings assigned to individual obligations or instruments, the agency typically rates to the likelihood of non-payment or default in accordance with the terms of that instrument?s documentation. In limited cases, Fitch Ratings may include additional considerations (i.e. rate to a higher or lower standard than that implied in the obligation?s documentation) and will make clear the assumptions underlying the agency?s opinion in the rating commentary.",

This would include:\na. the selective payment default on a specific class or currency of debt;\nb. the uncured expiry of any applicable grace period, cure period or default forbearance period following a payment default on a bank loan, capital markets security or other material financial obligation;\nc.\ufffdthe extension of multiple waivers or forbearance periods upon a payment default on one or more material financial obligations, either in series or in parallel; or\nd.\ufffdexecution of a coercive debt exchange on one or more material financial obligations.\n\nD: Default. ?D? ratings indicate an issuer that in Fitch Ratings? opinion has entered into bankruptcy filings, administration, receivership, liquidation or other formal winding-up procedure, or which has otherwise ceased business. \nIn addition, with respect to structured finance ratings, ratings in the 'CC' category and below are considered by Fitch to be materially impaired.   All such ratings are therefore also captured within CEREP default statistics in accordance with CEREP reporting requirements.\n\nPrior to 01/01/2006 Fitch's rating scale was slightly different. The effective definition of default has not changed but the rating RD was introduced after 01/01/2006. Recovery values were reflected in the D rating category before 01/01/2006. After this date recovery values have been reflected in the individual ratings of securities and not in the Issuer Default Rating."

The rating result is assigned to one of 22 grades (AAA to D) and supplemented by a rating outlook. The focal point of the rating procedure is the calculation of an overall score or combined result (point scores), which serves as a creditworthiness indicator and determines the assigned grade. The combined result is calculated on the basis of weighted points from the aggregated parameters financial profile and business profile. In principle, the procedure is designed for the purpose of assessing legally independent corporations that are active in the markets ? operating as going concerns. The indicators and criteria are analyzed, assessed and evaluated on the basis of the financial and business profiles in compliance with established internal rules and procedures. The financial profile is evaluated by analyzing financial strength, as expressed by long-term earning capacity and the capital available to cover risks. Indicators and qualitative criteria are applied to assess the relevant financial position and financial performance, and developments and changes are analyzed from a past, current and future perspective. Key sources of information are, in particular, annual and quarterly reports, planning information and if necessary additional disclosures. Examining the business profile focuses on analyzing relevant success and risk factors, while giving consideration to the corporation's development (from a past, current and future perspective). The assessment analyzes chiefly qualitative and forward-looking external and internal influencing factors. Criteria concerning e. g. the issues of strategy, the market, organization, risk management, risk profile and capitalization potential are evaluated. Supporting indicators are used to perform plausibility checks on the analyses and evaluations. Alongside relevant particularities, especially those relating to the company and business model, the success and risk factors governing various corporation types, are analyzed and consolidated to obtain a forward-looking and verifiable overall judgment. The business profile is assessed according to the relevant rating methodology (banks, building societies, lease financial institutions and small and medium sized companies) by making a distinction between different main criteria. Each of these main criteria is divided into sub-criteria. The criteria are measured against fixed assessment scales. Once a lead analyst and a second analyst have examined, assessed and verified all the criteria, the weighted scores are applied to obtain an overall business profile score for use in decision-making. A detailed manual contains descriptions, methods and outline requirements concerning the evaluation procedure for all criteria.",

These tests are performed at least once every six months.\n\nICAP assigns rating for a corporate debt instrument issue by applying expected recovery-driven notching on the long-term rating of the corporate issuer. The maintained assumption of this rating approach is that, on average, the rating of a senior unsecured debt instrument coincides with the rating of the issuer, which in turn reflects that on average the estimated overall recovery rate of the corporate in the event of default is in parity with the benchmark recovery rate of its respective sector. Possible deviations from such recovery rate parity would trigger notching upgrade in the event of higher expected recoveries than the benchmark or notching downgrade otherwise. Complementary assessments include the effects of country and counterparty risks as well as qualitative factors such as legal and audit opinions.\nGiven that the likelihood of default is captured in ICAP corporate ratings and that expected recoveries are estimated from both the assets of the corporation and potentially from structural enhancements, the resulting debt instrument rating reflects an expected loss in the event of default in the long-term aligned with the corporate rating horizon, which in turn assesses the likely ability to meet the ultimate obligations of the issue.",

Analysts selected to conduct a process on a given entity, contact the LGU?s management and set up a date of the visits. During the visits analysts conduct interviews with the Mayor and the Treasurer. Analysts also check the reliability of data provided by the LGU; \n\n2) Analysis from the macroeconomic perspective is another step in the rating process. There are two levels of macroeconomic influence on counties and municipalities which are regional (voivodeship) and country. In case of voivodeships we take into account only one level of macroeconomic influence ? country level. Indicators used by the Agency in macroeconomic analysis are e.g. (Unemployment rate, GDP per capita (nominal), Industrial production, Current account balance (%GDP), 10-year government bonds, Budget balance (%GDP), PMI, Inflation (CPI), Doing business (DTF, % points);\n\n3) Analysis of micro-economic situation of the rated entity is based on a thorough, multi-dimensional overview of the situation of the selected entity on the basis of data from its immediate surroundings. Indicators used by the Agency in microeconomic analysis are e.g. (Income per capita, Own income per capita, Expenditure per capita, Debt per capita, Unemployment rate, People using the social welfare, Enterprises, Companies with over 1000 employees (% of total companies), CIT / legal persons);\n\n4) To maintain impartiality of the opinion INC Rating uses also quantitative indicators to determine the quality of the local government?s management. Indicators used by the Agency in this analysis are e.g. (current income/planned current income, current expenditure/planned current expenditure, capital expenditure/planned capital expenditure, administration costs/current expenditure);\n\n5) Financial analysis of the local government is the most important part in the rating process. It is an outcome of local government?s macro and micro economical potential along with administrative decisions (the management). Therefore the outcome of the rating process is largely determined by the outcome of the local government budget?s financial analysis. Analysts compare almost 100 different indicators divided into 5 groups: budget, debt, income, expenditure and capital expenditure. (e.g. Net operating surplus/Net current income, Operating surplus/Current income, Surplus (deficit) before debt/Total income, Budget balance/Total income, Operating funds/Total income).",

    "has_methodology_description": "A credit rating is an assessment of one's ability to meet debt obligations, and pay principal and interest in accordance with financial agreements. Each individual obligation has its own contract, so the likelihood of the recovery of debts, should the issuer go bankrupt, varies according to each contract. A credit rating is therefore required to determine the likelihood that the obligor will go bankrupt and default on its obligation and the likelihood of recovery of the obligation should the obligor go bankrupt. Among other things, JCR focus on an obligor's creditworthiness as a going concern. The likelihood of the principal and interest being paid on time as specified in the contract is largely dependent on the obligor remaining financially stable and able to generate the necessary cash flow continuously as a going concern. At JCR, a credit rating assessing the capacity of the obligor to honor its financial commitment on the obligation is called \"Long-Term Issuer Rating\". In determining a Long-Term Issuer Rating, specific contractual details, preferred status among obligations, and the degree of recoverability are not taken into consideration, because the purpose of this rating is to get a comprehensive grasp of all of the obligor's obligations. Those individual factors are reflected in the assessment of individual obligations. Payments of obligations are taken from the cash flow generated from the obligor's daily operating activities. When assessing creditworthiness, it is therefore important to determine whether the profitability and stability of this cash flow matches that of the obligations to be repaid. It is extremely important to analyze the relative relationships between cash flow and obligations. When assessing creditworthiness, focus is placed on two main issues, the business and the financial foundations. In addition, JCR may take into consideration for the credit supports from the external sources, such as parent companies, Deposit Insurance System, etc. In the rating process, while the quantitative and qualitative analysis of industries and individual obligors is the core of the research, other results, such as JCR's original Individual Corporate Default Rate Estimation model, are used as reference data in the process of assessing creditworthiness as a means to enhance the objectivity of the rating. As mentioned above, the core foundation for a rating is the obligor's creditworthiness. The JCR rating codes indicate the degree of likelihood of this kind of default occurring. For the creditor, the likelihood of recovery under the bankruptcy is also a matter of significant interest. When there is a discrepancy in the likelihood of recovery among individual obligations, to the point of soliciting caution among the investors, there may be cases where the JCR assigns a notch differential from the Long-Term Issuer Rating. In assessing the likelihood of recovery, JCR takes three factors into consideration: (a) the level of creditworthiness of the obligor; (b) the financial structure of the obligor; and (c) the relative contractual position of the obligation being rated. For these factors, a notch differentiation by a mechanical application is not used. Instead, various factors are considered to comprehensively reach a determination. As JCR assesses an obligor's ability to perform its obligations over time, estimating the ability to generate income and predicting future financial conditions are important. Based on the current financial statements and management plans together with the perspective of industry trends and business foundations, JCR estimates future balance sheets, profits and losses and the future trend of operational indicators. In such cases, JCR also analyzes the obligation's sensitivity to changes in economic conditions and considers all \"worse case scenarios.\"",

    "has_methodology_description": "Please note, as of 17 August 2018, the responsible CRA for all ratings endorsed into the EU is Moody?s Deutschland GmbH. Moody's maintains rating methodologies for different rating categories. Moody's long-term ratings are opinions of the relative credit risk of financial obligations with an original maturity of one year or more. They address the possibility that a financial obligation will not be honored as promised. Such ratings use Moody's Global Scale and reflect both the likelihood of default and any financial loss suffered in the event of default. Long-Term Issuer Ratings are opinions of the ability of entities to honor long-term senior unsecured financial obligations and contracts. Moody's expresses Long-Term Issuer Ratings on one long-term Global Scale, which is common to all rating types. Moody's short-term ratings are opinions of the ability of issuers to honor short-term financial obligations. Short-term ratings may be assigned to issuers, short-term programs or to individual short-term debt instruments of any rating type. Such obligations generally have an original maturity not exceeding thirteen months, unless explicitly noted. The credit rating data submitted to the central repository is provided for Corporate, Financial Institutions and Sovereign and Public Finance ratings on an issuer level and not on a group basis. Structured Finance ratings and Covered Bond ratings are submitted to the central repository on an instrument basis. US municipal ratings are only provided since June 2010, when they were recalibrated on Moody's global long term rating scale. For ratings that were withdrawn prior to August 2010, the collateral type of the transaction was used to determine whether the rating related to a structured finance instrument. For long-term structured finance ratings, impairments (see below) and not defaults are reported and those that were issued prior to 1993 are excluded. Geographically Moody's classifies offshore entities into their legal domicile irrespective of the domicile of their parent company, if any. For example an offshore subsidy of a US based company legally domiciled in Cayman Islands is given the Cayman Islands ISO code.",

Unsolicited ratings for which MIS receives a subsequent solicitation will not be deemed unsolicited.",
    "has_default_definition": "Moody's definition of default is applicable only to debt or debt-like obligations. Four events constitute a debt default under Moody's definition: a) a missed or delayed disbursement of a contractually obligated interest or principal payment (excluding missed payments cured within a contractually allowed grace period), as defined in credit agreements and indentures; b) a bankruptcy filing or legal receivership by the debt issuer or obligor that will likely cause a miss or delay in future contractually-obligated debt service payments; c) a distressed exchange whereby 1) an obligor offers creditors a new or restructured debt, or a new package of securities, cash or assets that amount to a diminished financial obligation relative to the original obligation and 2) the exchange has the effect of allowing the obligor to avoid a bankruptcy or payment default in the future; or d) a change in the payment terms of a credit agreement or indenture imposed by the sovereign that results in a diminished financial obligation, such as a forced currency re-denomination (imposed by the debtor, himself, or his sovereign) or a forced change in some other aspect of the original promise, such as indexation or maturity. Moody's definition of default does not include so-called \"technical defaults\", such as maximum leverage or minimum debt coverage violations, unless the obligor fails to cure the violation and fails to honor the resulting debt acceleration which may be required. Also excluded are payments owed on long-term debt obligations which are missed due to purely technical or administrative errors which are 1) not related to the ability or willingness to make the payments and 2) are cured in very short order (typically, 1-2 business days). Moody's also maintains a definition for \"impairment\" that includes all events constituting a default as well as a downgrade to Ca or C."

An obligor is considered in default unless Standard & Poor's believes that such payments will be made within five business days of the due date in the absence of a stated grace period, or within the earlier of the stated grace period or 30 calendar days. A 'D' rating is assigned when Standard & Poor's believes that the default will be a general default and that the obligor will fail to pay all or substantially all of its obligations as they come due. An 'SD' rating is assigned when Standard & Poor's believes that the obligor has selectively defaulted on a specific issue or class of obligations but it will continue to meet its payment obligations on other issues or classes of obligations in a timely manner. An obligor's rating is lowered to 'D' or 'SD' if it is conducting a distressed exchange offer.
